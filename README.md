# CS-320-Software-Testing-and-Automation

This repo was the major assignment for my CS 320: Software Testing and Automation class at Southern New Hampshire University. This project was completed in Java utilizing JUnit tests.

1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I focus on thorough testing at every stage of development, from unit tests to final system tests. I can also stay mindful of common security risks with input validation and data protection, building good habits into my coding process instead of treating them as afterthoughts.

2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I try to listen carefully to what users are asking for, then break it down into clear features that solve real problems for them. I also will stay flexible, knowing that user needs can change during a project, and I’m ready to adjust the design to keep the program useful and easy to work with.

3. How do I approach designing software?

When I design software, I start by planning out the basic structure and making sure I understand how different modules will work together. I like to keep the design simple and organized at first, so it’s easier to add features later without the project becoming a mess. Keeping this organization allows for easy itteration and understanding of the code-base.
